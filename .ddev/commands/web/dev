## Description: Run development services (Horizon, Vite, Pail) concurrently inside ddev
## Usage: dev
## Example: "ddev dev"

# Get the project root directory
cd /var/www/html || exit 1

# Check if concurrently is available
if ! command -v npx &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: npx is not available. Please ensure Node.js is installed."
    exit 1
fi

# Run horizon, vite, and pail concurrently
# Note: We don't run 'php artisan serve' because ddev already provides nginx
# Note: articles:subscribe is running via supervisor (web_extra_daemons in config.yaml)
# Color scheme matches the composer.json dev script
